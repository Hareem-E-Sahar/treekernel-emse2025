/**
 * <code>JapaneseCalendar</code> is a subclass of <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
 * that numbers years and eras based on the reigns of the Japanese emperors.
 * The Japanese calendar is identical to the Gregorian calendar in all respects
 * except for the year and era.  The ascension of each  emperor to the throne
 * begins a new era, and the years of that era are numbered starting with the
 * year of ascension as year 1.
 * <p>
 * Note that in the year of an imperial ascension, there are two possible sets
 * of year and era values: that for the old era and for the new.  For example, a
 * new era began on January 7, 1989 AD.  Strictly speaking, the first six days
 * of that year were in the Showa era, e.g. "January 6, 64 Showa", while the rest
 * of the year was in the Heisei era, e.g. "January 7, 1 Heisei".  This class
 * handles this distinction correctly when computing dates.  However, in lenient
 * mode either form of date is acceptable as input. 
 * <p>
 * In modern times, eras have started on January 8, 1868 AD, Gregorian (Meiji),
 * July 30, 1912 (Taisho), December 25, 1926 (Showa), and January 7, 1989 (Heisei).  Constants
 * for these eras, suitable for use in the <code>ERA</code> field, are provided
 * in this class.  Note that the <em>number</em> used for each era is more or
 * less arbitrary.  Currently, the era starting in 1053 AD is era #0; however this
 * may change in the future as we add more historical data.  Use the predefined
 * constants rather than using actual, absolute numbers.
